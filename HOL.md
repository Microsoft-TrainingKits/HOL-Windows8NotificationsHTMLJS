### Getting Started: Deploying the Notification App Server Using Web Deploy###

In this exercise, you deploy the notification app server to Windows Azure using Web Deploy. To do this, you provision the required service components at the management portal, request credentials from the WNS and Live Connect portal and deploy to Windows Azure using Web Deploy.   

<a name="GSTask1" />
#### Task 1 – Creating a Storage Account and Web Site ####

The application you deploy in this exercise requires a Web Site and a Storage Account. In this task, you create a new storage account to allow the application to persist its data. In addition, you define a Web Site to host the notification app server.

1. Navigate to [<https://manage.windowsazure.com>](<https://manage.windowsazure.com>) using a Web browser and sign in using the Microsoft Account associated with your Windows Azure account.

	![Signing in to the Windows Azure platform Management portal](./Images/signing-in-to-the-windows-azure-platform-mana.png?raw=true)

	_Signing in to the Windows Azure platform Management portal_

1. First, you will create the **Storage Account** that the application will use to store its data. In the Windows Azure Management Portal, click **New** | **Data Services** | **Storage** | **Quick Create**.

1. Set a unique **URL**, for example _notificationapp_, and select **Create Storage Account**.
 
	![Creating a new storage account](./Images/creating-a-new-storage-account.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new storage account_

	> **Note:** The URL used for the storage account corresponds to a DNS name and is subject to standard DNS naming rules. Moreover, the name is publicly visible and must therefore be unique. The portal ensures that the name is valid by verifying that the name complies with the naming rules and is currently available. A validation error will be shown if you enter a name that does not satisfy the rules.
	>
	> ![URL Validation](./Images/url-validation.png?raw=true)

1. Wait until the Storage Account is created. Click your storage account's name to go to its **Dashboard**.

	![Storage Accounts page](./Images/storage-accounts-page.png?raw=true "Storage Accounts page")

	_Storage Accounts page_

1.	Click **Manage Keys** at the bottom of the page in order to show the storage account's access keys.

	![Manage Keys](./Images/manage-keys-option.png?raw=true "Manage Keys")

	_Manage Storage Account Keys_

1. Copy the **Storage Acount Name** and the **Primary access key**. You will use these values later on to configure the application.

	![Manage Storage Account Keys](./Images/manage-storage-account-keys.png?raw=true "Manage Storage Account Keys")

	_Manage Storage Account Keys_

	>**Note:** The **Primary Access Key** and **Secondary Access Key** both provide a shared secret that you can use to access storage. The secondary key gives the same access as the primary key and is used for backup purposes. You can regenerate each key independently in case either one is compromised.

1. Go back to the portal home page, and select **Web Sites**.

1. Select **New**, then select **Compute** | **Web Site** from the list and then **Quick Create**.

1. Choose a name for your Web Site and then select **Create Web Site**.

	![Creating a new Web Site](./Images/creating-a-new-web-site.png?raw=true)
	
	_Creating a new Web Site_

<a name="GSTask2" />
#### Task 2 – Updating the application with your Storage Account Name and Key ####
In this task, you will update the Connection String values within the web configuration file using the Storage Account you created in the previous task.

1. In a new instance of **Visual Studio 2012**, open **Services.sln** located in the **Source/Assets/Server/Notifications.Backend** folder.  This is the Notification App Server.

1. Open **Web.config**.  In the **appsettings** section, replace the value of the **DataConnectionString** setting using the recommended format as shown in the commented lines in the snippet below.

	````XML
	<!--
		When deploying to Windows Azure, replace the DataConnectionString setting with the
		connection string for your Windows Azure Storage account. For example:
		"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={your storage account name};AccountKey={your storage account key}"
	-->
	<add key="DataConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={your storage account};AccountKey={your storage account key}"/>
	````

1. Press **CTRL+SHIFT+B** to build the solution.

<a name="Exercise2" />
### Exercise 2: Sending Push Notifications ###

This section describes how to run your client application and send notifications to it through the notification app server deployed to Windows Azure in the previous exercises.  

<a name="Ex2Task1" />
#### Task 1 – Running the Notification enabled Windows 8 Style UI App ####

In this task, you will run the client application you created in the previous exercise to create a channel for the WNS and register it with the Notification App Server.

1.	Open the **Notifications.Client.sln** Style UI App located under **Source/Ex2-SendingPushNotifications/Begin** folder. Alternatively, you may continue with the solution that you obtained after completing the previous exercise.

	> **Note:** If you chose to open the solution in the Begin folder, you will have to open the **notifications.js** file and update the url to point to the correct endpoint.  Update the **serverUrl** value _[YOUR_DNS_NAME]_ in http://_[YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN]_/endpoints. You obtain the **DNS** value from the web site you created in the **Windows Azure Management Portal**.

	>	`var serverUrl = "http://[YOUR_WEBSITE_DOMAIN]/endpoints";`

1.	Once the solution has opened press **F5**. Due the configuration you made previously when the application launches it will call **openNotificationsChannel()** method. This will request a channel from **WNS** and submit it to the **Notifications App Server** you deployed to Windows Azure.  In the **statusMessage** div, you will see that the **Channel URI** was sent successfully to your service.

	![Client output after successful channel request from WNS and registering with notification app server](./Images/client-output-after-successful-channel-reques.png?raw=true)

	_Client output after successful channel request from WNS and registering with notification app server_

<a name="Ex2Task2" />
#### Task 2 – Sending Push Notifications using the ASP .NET MVC 4 Portal ####

Now that a channel has been successfully requested from WNS and registered with your Notification App Server we can now start to send notifications through the portal.

1.	Switch to the Web browser and log into your deployed application (e.g: http://_[YOUR_SUBDOMAIN]_/.cloudapp.net), using the following credentials:
	1. User Name: **admin**
	1. Password: ![password](./Images/password.png?raw=true) (with a zero)

1.	Once logged in, additional menu options are displayed to allow you to send push notifications and manage the images (blobs) used when sending notifications.

	![Notification App Server Home Page](./Images/notification-app-server-home-page.png?raw=true)

	_Notification App Server Home Page_

1.	Click the **Push Notifications** menu option. Here you will see the channel that you requested using the sample Windows 8 Style UI app that registered with your Web Role.

	![Pushing Notifications](./Images/pushing-notifications.png?raw=true)
	
	_Pushing Notifications_

	> **Note:** If you re-register your channel from your client app while this page is open it is worthwhile refreshing the page to ensure that you have captured the latest channel uri.

1.	You can now send your first _toast_ notification to this channel. Click **Send Notification** button to open the notifications template dialog window.

1.	Select **Toast** in the first drop-down list and then select the **ToastImageAndText01** template.

1.	Configure the template column with your Square **WindowsAzureLogo.png** and type some text into **Regular text** as per below:

	![Selecting notification type and template](./Images/selecting-notification-type-and-template.png?raw=true)

	_Selecting notification type and template_

1.	Click **Send** and observe that the Web portal indicates that the message was successfully delivered to **WNS** and the _Toast_ notification arrives to the Client application.

	![Notification sent confirmation](./Images/notification-sent-confirmation.png?raw=true)

	_Notification sent confirmation_

	>**Note:**  If you are getting a 403 unauthorized or no notifications showing up please try refreshing the page to ensure that the channel that you are sending to is refreshed.  Following this, please check that you created your WNS credentials with the correct CN from your package.appxmanifest and that you have configured your package.appxmanifest and Web.config correctly.

1.	Now you will see how to send a _Tile_ notification. Select **Tile** in the first drop-down and then select the **TileWideImageAndText01** template.

1.	Configure the template column with:
	1.	Your wide logo **WindowsAzureLogoWide.png**.
	1.	Custom text to be displayed in **Large Text** and **Regular Text**.
	1.	Click **Send**.

		![Pushing a Tile notification](./Images/pushing-a-tile-notification.png?raw=true)

		_Pushing a Tile notification_

1.	Return to **Start** by pressing the **Windows key** ( ![start](./Images/start.png?raw=true)) and observe that your _Tile_ notification has now been delivered and is being displayed.

	![Delivered Tile notification](./Images/delivered-tile-notification.png?raw=true)
	
	_Delivered Tile notification_

1.	Now you will see how to send a _Badge_ notification. Select **Badge** in the first drop-down list and then select the **Glyph** template.

1.	In the template column select the **NewMessage** option and click **Send**.

	![Pushing a Badge notification](./Images/pushing-a-badge-notification.png?raw=true)

	_Pushing a Badge notification_

1.	Return to **Start** by pressing the **Windows key** ( ![start](./Images/start.png?raw=true)) and observe that your _Tile_ has now the _Badge_ updated to see the NewMessage Glyph type:

	![Updated Tile notification with a Badge](./Images/updated-tile-notification-with-a-badge.png?raw=true)

	_Updated Tile notification with a Badge_

	>**Note:** This concludes the overview of how to send Toast, Tile and Badge notifications using the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows 8. As an exercise, it’s recommended to spend some time both exploring the rich set of templates available to each of the different notification types and how you can use blob storage to store your image assets for notifications.
