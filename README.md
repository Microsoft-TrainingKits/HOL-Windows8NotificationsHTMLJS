## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-On Labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features.  Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy a  version of the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows 8 to Windows Azure and then utilize this deployment to send notifications to your client application via the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS).
