# Sending Push Notifications using Windows Azure and the Windows Push Notification Service #

## Hands-on Lab ##

### Introduction ###

Hands-On Labs are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features.  Each Lab provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy a pre-packaged version of the Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows 8 to Windows Azure and then utilize this deployment to send notifications to your client application via the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS).

> **Note:** You can download the latest build of the Windows Azure Training Kit which includes a tested version of this HOL from here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8396.
